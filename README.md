Game Development Practice Modules

Recently I decided to pick up Game Development, and I leave here both the 2d and the 3d project to prove that intent.
Squash the creeps and creepdodge are both built from the standard godot tutorials, but they're finished and they're playable.

I will be adding to this repository periodically to record my progress through the GDQuest 2D game development course.
